### Our Problem
<p align="justify">Ever been stuck in the endless cycle of filing paperwork for medical insurance? Then you must also be familiar with the requirement of filling dozens of forms, submitting tons of documents and panicking over the lost records. Looking frantically for carelessly kept physical records is a stressful sport as well. The surveillance given to legal, official and business documents overwhelmingly exceeds the attention towards medical reports. Leaving the task of compilation for another day, physical reports ultimately get eroded from our mind, leaving us baffled at times of grave emergencies. </p>

<p align="justify">So, in an era defined primarily by the ever-evolving technology and sky-rocketing science, donâ€™t you often wonder if medical documentation somehow got easier, simpler and more accessible? If yes, **UpHealth is the key to your worries!** </p>
