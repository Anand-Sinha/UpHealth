##### During these difficult times, health is our primary concern and our prior health data is very important to trace our fitness and for doctors to diagnose us.

##### You take care of all your legal and personal documents but when it comes to medical documents they don't get the same importance.

- What if you went into an emergency and the doctor need your medical history?
- What if you change your Doctor and he asks about your previous medication?
- Don't you think it would be awesome if you get a visualization of your daily fitness like Blood Sugar, Blood Pressure, BMI with interactive charts and graphs?

##### Have you ever wonder if you can get all your documents in one place organized and all your reports visualized with graphs and charts. Our application does the same so that you can do all the above-mentioned things in one place.

Our application helps you to store **all your medical records in one place** and we will keep them **safe and secure** with ourselves so that you can find what you are looking for in your medical history in just a matter of seconds. Also, you can **track and visualize your daily fitness records** with our interactive graphs. All of these features **with authentication and authorization** so that only you can access your data.

Whenever a user chooses to upload their **data (Prescription)** with us, we publish their documents to the marketplace and the data coins generated will be rewarded to the user.

**Future Scope:** In future when a user book their appointment with a doctor they can pay their doctors using data coins they earned by just uploading their prescriptions with us.
